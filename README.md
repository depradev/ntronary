# ntronary
netorare hentai org-roam wiki  
For now almost everything is still inside the file ntr.org  
Basically, this is my coomfile.  
But inside the "nodes" folder you can appreciate the true shape of the project.  
## WHAT?
The current structure is a single org file which I intend to split per artwork, with an extra node per artist.  
I only include artworks with enough artistic quality or interesting stories, the metric being how hard my pp gets and how much would I remember them.  
## WHY?
What's the goal of making suck a wiki?  
I can search back any hentai I need to  
I'm not dependent on search engines. What if saucenao ever goes away?  
All this information and effort is a waste if I keep it just for my eyes.
## HOW?
Each entry is a summary that includes the most relevant words(moments) to enable searching with regexes.  
## GOAL?
Create a wiki that enables searching (today regexes, tomorrow semantic searches) and points to the resource, potentially creating a backup of them on a system like ipfs.  
Create an enduring id system for them, like nhentai url numbers.  
Create a centralized reviews go-to, instead of slim and scattered review blogs.  
## WHERE?
I believe that a VCS is the best shot at creating something like this.  
My personal org-roam garden has so much information and it only weighs a few Mb.  
## WHAT THEN?
I would welcome and merge-in similar efforts of equivalent dedication.  
Then we could operate as silos where summary-reviews for the same artwork get included in a single file.
Structuring-formating ideas are welcome.
## INSTRUCTIONS
Emacs is a text editor, org and org-roam is one of it's most successful applications. That said, you wouldn't need it to write-see the entries because it's almost a txt.  
Just a quick look? Currently most of the structure is: name, then summary, then links.  
For now you could go here and see the file: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/depradev/ntronary/master/ntr.org  
For the full experience you would:  
git clone https://github.com/depradev/ntronary  
as a folder inside your org-roam directory, the graph was made with org-roam-ui
