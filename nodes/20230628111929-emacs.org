- parent: [[id:d7915fca-1ef4-4b84-990b-1a9a7d376c4b][help]]
* SEARCH INFORMATION
- you would use a program like **rg** to look for regex matches like the artwork name, do so inside the git clone directory
  - rg has an emacs package available too, so you can ==M-x rg==
* OPERATIONAL INFORMATION
The idea would be to:
git clone https://github.com/depradev/ntronary
as a folder inside your org-roam directory

Then you could add this to your config to have a quick template to create them inside that folder:

You ==link== to subjects, and ==tag== based on node properties

#+end_src

- ntronary normal
  - the one used the most
  - uses the TITLE as an appendage-subject targetting the reader
    - a message to clarify, something that the reader will read
    - a message outside the artwork content
  - the filename is just the timestamp at creation, which as a random number I argue is enough of an ID for the artwork
- ntronary special
  - reserved for special notes (not artworks nor artists)
    - like: topics or subjects (==the tags for the doujins==)
  - uses the TITLE as intended
    - using the "TITLE" string in the file name
    - for that use the "NAMES" filed in the note (my convention)
** LINKAGE
- it's reverse linkage, you would link to the previous (not the next) artwork
  - also the artist name
- this way there is no need to edit accient nodes
  - worry not, the org-roam-buffer (==a tool that should always be activated==), is the tool that allows you to find both the next artwork (if any) and the artist name
