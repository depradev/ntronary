# ntronary
netorare hentai org-roam wiki  
## WHAT'S THIS?
A wiki made of nodes. The nodes being structured text files.  
A node per artwork, topic, artist, and how they all connect to each other.  
I only include artworks with enough artistic quality or interesting stories, the metric being how hard my pp gets and how much would I remember them.  
## WHY?
What's the goal of making-sharing such a wiki?  
I can search back any hentai I need to.  
I'm not dependent on search engines. What if saucenao ever goes away?  
And I'm sharing it as all this information and effort is a waste if I keep it just for my eyes. And maybe to prevent duplication of effort.
## HOW?
Each entry-node is a summary that includes the most relevant words(moments) to enable searching with regexes.  
It also contains links to the resource.
## GOAL?
Create a wiki that enables searching (today with regexes, tomorrow with semantic searches).
Create a centralized reviews go-to, instead of scattered review blogs.  
Create an enduring id system for them, inspired by nhentai url numbers.  
Creating a backup of them on a system like ipfs.  
## TECHNICAL?
A VCS is the best shot at creating something like this.  
My personal org-roam garden has so much information and it only weighs a few Mb.  
## WHAT NOW?
I would welcome and merge-in similar efforts of equivalent dedication.  
Then we could operate as silos.
I welcome structuring-formating ideas.
## WHAT IS ntrotica.org?
It's a similar effort but for cuckold-erotica literary works, from sites like literotica.  
It differs in that it's all contained into a single file, using org-tags instead of roam nodes.  
## INSTRUCTIONS, HOW TO USE
git clone https://github.com/depradev/ntronary  
as a folder inside your org-roam directory, the graph is interactive and was made with org-roam-ui  
To on-the-fly get an interactive list of the artists artworks, you would use the backlink system.  
### USE WITHOUT EMACS
Alternatively, if you aren't using emacs nor org-roam, you could use the index.org for the artist and then seach for the node. Or find their artworks by using it as regex using a tool like rg.
